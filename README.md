# Realtime Database integration with flutter and firebase

A practice for my IOT course where I had to send the data from several sensors through my esp32
to firebase and save it in a Realtime Database to later access it through flutter and display it in a graphical interface.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
